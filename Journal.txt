[Start of records]

Sunday, 30th of April
- Soldier ants now do soldier things.
- They still ignore their duties of protecting everyone when a giant insect passes by.

Tuesday, 2nd of May
- Brainwashed my worker and soldier ants, no more slacking.
- Soldier ants do respond to threats, as they now do not know the concept of slacking. I fear I might gone too far
  with my brainwashing process as they now are otherworldly stupid to know the concept of waiting for each other.
- What my clown side meant with the previous statement is that cyclicbarrier is not working properly.
- I should start making baby ants for next session.

Wednesday, 3rd of May
- Baby ants now go gugu gahgah.
- They are too stupid to even save themselves when a big guy shows in the morning. I should make something that scoop
  them to the refuge.

Thursday, 4th of May
- All ants types are FINALLY in good shape.
- Baby ants are now sufficiently sentient for finding the refuge.
- Surveillance cameras were installed everywhere, so now it's easier to catch SLACKING ants (logging system was
  implemented).
- I should start making the nest a little prettier with GUI, either with FX or Sway.

Friday, 5th of May
- I chose JavaFX because imma a brave boy.
- I am also a lazy boy today.

Saturday, 6th of May
- I regret choosing JavaFX.
- WHY CANNOT I MODIFY MY GUI THINGS?!?! WHAT IS PLATFORM.RUNNABLE?!?!
- WHY IS IT SO SLOW?!
- :(
- I think I am now in possession of the deep knowledge of the black magic known as maven.

Sunday, 7th of May
- I think I understand JavaFX now.
- My application seems to fully work now.
- Life is not a shade of black anymore.
- I just found that worker ants are SO FAT that they get stuck in the storage room (synchronization deadlock).
