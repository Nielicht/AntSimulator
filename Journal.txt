[Start of records]

Sunday, 30th of April
- Soldier ants routine implemented.
- You have to find a way to alert soldier ants of an insect invasion.

Tuesday, 2nd of May
- Reworked running code of Workers and Soldiers.
- Soldier ants now respond to threatening insects, but cyclicBarrier seems to have problems with big amounts of Ants.
- Baby ants should be done for next session

Wednesday, 3rd of May
- Added the base for the baby ants behaviour.
- I failed attempting to implement the Ants REFUGE behaviour. I must find a way to preferably sleep them until the
  invasor is repelled.

Thursday, 4th of May
- All ants types are FINALLY done.
- Baby ants are now perfectly capable of finding the refuge.
- Surveillance cameras were installed everywhere, so now it's easier to catch SLACKING ants (logging system was
  implemented).
- I should start with the GUI implementation next session, so... FX or sway?
